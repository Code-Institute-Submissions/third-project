Choose how the information is presented to me, for example:

Number of drinks per page

Sort by name, views, comments, favorites, difficulty, and date

Sort either ascending or descending

Search the database for drinks that match key words of my choosing and order the results either based on their relevance to what I searched for, or some other criteria of my own choosing.

Do this on any device and browser of my choosing and have the same experience, and access to the same data, regardless of device and browser type.

Most importantly, as a user I want to be able to do this with minimal effort. I want to instinctively know how to use the site, and not have to search for how to do something. I want it to just work, and not have to fight to make it work. Finally, above all else, I want to enjoy using the site.
